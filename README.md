# καθαρός (katharós; clean) Minecraft Resource Pack

## Summary

No magic, no zombies, no luck.

## Description

It is a resource pack that tries to remove most of the supernatural elements from Minecraft. Scientific, more rational and sci-fi ideas and concepts are used instead.

### Due credit

Some mob skins were heavily inspired by other modpacks, and some of them were initially picked out and just retouched a bit. I have no idea which ones but I really want to give due credit. Please reach out to me by creating an issue if you are the original creator of one of the mob skins. Thank you!
